# Bird Sorting Puzzle Game

## 🐦 Overview
This is a bird-sorting puzzle game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, where you can either play manually or watch AI algorithms solve the puzzle for you. The game features multiple AI search algorithms and tracks performance statistics and player scores.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. **Install Python**  
   Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2. **Install Pygame**  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

##  How to Run

1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python application.py

## How to Use

When the program starts, you’ll see a menu with **four buttons**:

1. **Play Game**  
   Start the game in manual mode and sort the birds yourself.

2. **AI Algorithms**  
   Choose from a variety of AI search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Greedy, etc.) to solve the puzzle.  
   For some algorithms (A*, Weighted A* and Greedy), you'll need to select a **heuristic** before starting.

3. **Player Leaderboard**  
   View the top player scores based on performance (moves time taken and board size).

4. **AI Statistics**  
   View performance graphs for each AI algorithm.  
   Each time you press a new button in this section, a new graph will be generated and displayed.
